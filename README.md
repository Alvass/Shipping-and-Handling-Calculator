## Situation
The operation director was tasked to reduce the current operation cost as it started to erode margins. She ran some Kaizen to review processes and streamline them to make more efficient and cost effective but she wanted to recoup some of the shipping cost we were fully absorb on behalf of the customer.

## Task
She asked if I could find a way to determine a % of the full shipping on any products we were manufacturing and sold.

## Action
I started to compile the list of all products manufactured and sold for the last 5 years and worked with department like Dispatch, logistic and trade compliance to establish the packaging dimension for each references and special shipment required. Once I received all the internal information about our product, I used the current price list from the main freight forwarded and started to build the calculator using vlookup and If formula to establish a % of the total shipping cost I also create a quick guide to guide the sales team and the admin team how to use it.

## Result
The first 12 months this calculator was used enable the company to save Â£400k on shipping cost. Alongside other improvements, my director was able to exceed her target with the support of this calculator built in Excel
